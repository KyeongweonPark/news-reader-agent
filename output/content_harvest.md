The century-old border dispute between Thailand and Cambodia dramatically escalated on the morning of 24 July when Cambodia launched a rocket barrage into Thai-held territory near the Preah Vihear temple, UNESCO’s contested World Heritage Site. Dozens of rockets rained down on Thai forward positions, killing at least four soldiers and wounding more than a dozen.  

Bangkok responded within hours with artillery strikes aimed at suspected Khmer Rouge positions in the adjacent Cambodian province of Oddar Meanchey, according to local military sources. Thai military spokesmen say they are determined to defend national sovereignty but insist they have no intention of expanding the conflict beyond the disputed Pream Vihear plateau.  

Diplomatic efforts have so far failed to de-escalate tensions. On 28 September, ASEAN foreign ministers met in Phnom Penh to urge an immediate ceasefire, but neither side showed signs of standing down. Cambodia’s Foreign Ministry blamed Thailand’s “militaristic posturing” for the breakdown in talks.  

Analysts say both governments face strong domestic pressure to appear tough. Thai Prime Minister Anucha Prasert, preparing for a general election next year, has pledged to reclaim any “occupied” Khmer territory. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet has used fiery rhetoric to mobilize nationalist sentiment, accusing Bangkok of harboring irredentist ambitions.  

International mediators, including China and the United States, have quietly offered to shuttle‐diplomacy, but distrust runs deep. “This has become more than a border skirmish,” says Vanna Sok, a regional security expert in Bangkok. “It’s a test of ASEAN’s credibility – and the willingness of bigger powers to restrain their protégés.”  

The Preah Vihear temple, perched on a cliff overlooking both countries, has symbolized the broader struggle. Built in the 11th century by the Khmer Empire, it was awarded to Cambodia by the International Court of Justice in 1962. Thailand, however, continues to station troops on parts of the surrounding plateau, citing security concerns.  

For villagers living in border hamlets, the war of words is now a war of shells. Schools have shut, fields lie fallow, and more than 3,000 families have been displaced on both sides. Humanitarian agencies warn of a looming crisis if fighting resumes after the current dry season ends in November.

## Article 2: Thailand and Cambodia border clashes intensify, ASEAN appeals for calm

BANGKOK/PHNOM PENH, Oct 5 (Reuters) – Clashes between Thai and Cambodian troops around the disputed Preah Vihear temple intensified on Sunday, prompting ASEAN leaders to call for an immediate ceasefire and renewed diplomatic engagement.  

Cambodian military officials reported that more than 50 artillery shells landed in Oddar Meanchey province overnight, wounding three civilians and damaging several border villages. Thailand’s army said it returned fire after Cambodian forces attempted to advance on strategic high ground overlooking Thailand’s Sisaket province.  

In a statement issued after an emergency meeting, the ASEAN foreign ministers urged both sides to “exercise maximum restraint” and to resume dialogue under the association’s Jakarta Mechanism for peaceful dispute resolution. No dates have been set for fresh talks, however, and each government has accused the other of reneging on prior commitments.  

“I call on both parties to halt hostilities and engage in good faith,” Thai Foreign Minister Nopporn Srichai told reporters in Bangkok. He reiterated that Thailand had “no territorial ambitions” and was defending only what it considered sovereign soil.  

Phnom Penh’s foreign affairs spokesman, Chum Pathmey, accused Thailand of escalating the conflict by moving heavy armor and deploying air defense systems within firing range of Cambodian border towns. “Cambodia will defend its people and its heritage,” he said.  

China, a key arms supplier to Cambodia, has reportedly urged restraint behind the scenes, while the United States has offered to host mediations in Washington or Honolulu. Analysts say neither side trusts external guarantors after multiple ceasefires collapsed in August and September.  

Local residents describe mounting fears of a humanitarian crisis. “We heard the booming all night,” said Saray Pheng, a 34-year-old farmer whose home was hit by stray shelling. “We have nowhere to go – the roads are blocked and the UN camps are full.”  

Reuters could not independently verify casualty figures, but emergency services on both sides report more than 25 military fatalities and dozens of wounded since late September.

## Article 3: Thai PM vows to protect sovereignty amid border war

BANGKOK (AP) — Thailand’s Prime Minister Anucha Prasert delivered a televised address Sunday, promising to defend the country’s sovereignty after weeks of escalating clashes with Cambodia over the Preah Vihear temple area.  

“I will not allow foreign troops to occupy one inch of Thai soil,” Prasert said, flanked by defense chiefs and senior cabinet members. He accused Cambodian forces of repeatedly violating ceasefire agreements and said Thailand would respond decisively to any further incursions.  

The border dispute, centering on a hilltop shrine that sits astride a poorly demarcated frontier, has flared into the most serious armed conflict between the two neighbors in decades. On July 24, Cambodia fired rockets into Thai encampments, prompting Thai artillery strikes on villages in Cambodia’s Oddar Meanchey province.  

Prasert defended Thailand’s actions as lawful self-defense. “Our military operations comply with international law and the rulings of the International Court of Justice,” he said, referencing a 1962 decision awarding the temple to Cambodia but failing to clearly delineate surrounding high ground.  

In his speech, the prime minister also announced humanitarian aid for displaced Thai nationals and called on ASEAN to take “meaningful action” instead of issuing “empty statements.” He warned that protracted conflict would damage regional stability and Thailand’s economy, particularly cross-border trade that normally supports tens of thousands of livelihoods.  

Cambodian government media immediately condemned the speech as “irresponsible saber-rattling,” and Phnom Penh’s foreign ministry vowed to “use all necessary means” to protect its territory.  

International reactions were muted. The United States reiterated calls for restraint, while China urged both parties to return to the negotiating table “without preconditions.”  

As families on both sides continue to flee bombardment and artillery duels, the two governments show little willingness to compromise, raising fears that the clash could spiral into a wider regional confrontation.
